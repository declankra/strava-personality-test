**How It Works**

- After clicking get CTA button, user grants permission for app to read user‚Äôs posts data (through OAuth 2.0, you can request the activity:read scope, which gives you access to their activities, including the titles.)
- Extract titles from last 100 posts (use GET /api/v3/athlete/activities endpoint -> endpoint returns an array of activities, including name field (which is the title))
- CAll OpenAI API to analyze titles using instructions/context on task-> return results in the results page
- Results:
    - 1. Strava personality match
    - 2. Explanation (2-3 sentences of why you matched, referencing real titles you posted)

**Design**

- **Style:** clean, sleek, minimalistic, uncluttered, and modern style with neutral colors (using shadcn zinc) and ample white space. occasionally uses sharp, crisp animations to keep visitors engaged, adding a ‚Äúwow‚Äù effect.
- **Color Scheme:**
    - primary color = bright orange (like Strava color)
    - primary base = white
    - base content = shade of black-ish
    - base = white
